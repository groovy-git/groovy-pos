/**
 * Backups of the shop: a copy of this Sheet plus the invoice PDFs, into the Back_up folder that sits
 * beside them in Drive.
 *
 *   Back_up/2026-08/              ← made on 1 September, holds August
 *   Back_up/2026-09-25 09-15/     ← made by hand, holds whatever was asked for
 *
 * Two ways in: "Back up now…" in the Groovy POS menu, and a trigger on the 1st of each month at 6am
 * that saves the month just ended. The monthly folder is named for the month it covers, so running it
 * again lands in the same folder and copies nothing twice.
 *
 * A backup can take longer than Apps Script allows in one go, so it is built to be interrupted: a
 * marker file says the folder is unfinished and carries what is left to do, files already copied are
 * skipped, and a one-off trigger picks the job up a minute later. Nothing is remembered anywhere else
 * — Drive itself is the record, as it is for the invoice PDFs.
 *
 * Nothing is ever deleted here.
